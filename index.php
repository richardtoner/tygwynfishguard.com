			<p class="lead">Ty Gwyn is a very attractive, traditional stone cottage which has been renovated to a high standard with oak flooring, beams, comfortable sofas and a woodburner. It is a 3 bedroom property conveniently situated on a quiet residential street a level walk from Fishguard town centre with its shops, restaurants and pubs. There is on-street parking for two cars outside. The fitted kitchen/diner leads out via a rear porch to a lovely split level garden surrounded by wooden fencing. The Pembrokeshire Coastal Path is easily accessible whilst a short downhill walk will take you to Fishguard's picturesque harbour.</p>
