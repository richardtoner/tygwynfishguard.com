			<h2>The Cottage &amp; Garden</h2>
			<p class="lead">We originally bought Ty Gwyn for our own use and retirement but as so often happens, life changes and we now have a wonderful little grand daughter we want to be close to. However, the refurbishment was very much carried out with a view to living in the property and we have chosen high quality fixtures and fittings to create a real home from home, with many little touches we think guests will enjoy.</p>
