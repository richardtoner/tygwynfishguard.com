			<h2>The Cottage &amp; Garden</h2>
			<p class="lead">We originally bought Ty Gwyn for our own use and retirement but as so often happens, life changes and we now have a wonderful little grand daughter we want to be close to. However, the refurbishment was very much carried out with a view to living in the property and we have chosen high quality fixtures and fittings to create a real home from home, with many little touches we think guests will enjoy.</p>

						<h3>Living Room</h3>
						<p>The large living room is very comfortable with two large sofas, chaise, woodburner, plasma TV with Sky, DVD player and oak flooring. A selection of books and childrens games are contained within the oak sideboard. It will easily seat six in comfort.</p>

					<h3>Bedrooms</h3>
