			<h3>Fishguard</h3>
			<p>Fishguard consists of two separate and distinct areas – Lower Town, ie the area around the harbour and Upper Town – where Ty Gwyn is situated.</p>
			<p>Lower Town (turn right out of the cottage, first right and first right again and down the steep hill) is very picturesque and is often used as a location for film sets.   Worth a walk but the hill backup is a bit of a killer – we usually catch the bus back to the Square!   Alternatively you can follow the signs for ‘Marine Walk’ which is a pretty walk around the headland and will take you back to the town centre.  Lower Town was used as the venue for the filming of Moby Dick and Under Milk Wood – you will see some memorabilia on the walls of the Ship Inn there.</p>
			<p>Upper Town – turn right out of the cottage, right at the end and then left and you are in Market Square, the town centre.  There’s a good selection of shops here as you would expect in a busy market town.</p>
			<p>There’s a farmer’s market every Thursday morning in the Town Hall in Market Square where they sell meat, fish, cheeses, bread etc.  It’s worth a visit for good local produce.   Also every other Saturday – keep an eye out for placards around the town.    You can enter in the back way at the end of the street – it’s a short cut to the Square.</p>
			<p>You are spoilt for choice for pubs in Fishguard; within walking distance (5 – 10mins) are quite a few and here’s a quick run down:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Cambrian – Corner of the street.  Popular with locals.  Mine hosts Graham and June.</li>
				<li>Royal Oak – Market Sq. Historical, famous pub and popular with tourists.  Where the surrender of the last invasion of Britain was signed.</li>
				<li>Fishguard Arms – tiny little pub with a fire.  Instead of turning left into Market Square opposite 3 Main St turn right and it’s about 50ft up, just after the ice cream parlour.  Beware the organic cider.   Bit tatty.</li>
				<li>The Coach House – Mixed age group and popular on weekends, more for the younger element.</li>
				<li>Fishguard and Goodwick Rugby Club (near the Post Office)– exactly as it says but a good 15 min walk.  Great if you want to watch an international!  Cheap beer during matches.  Well worth a visit – non members are welcome.</li>
				<li>The Ship Inn – Lower Town. Turn right from the cottage, first right and right at the end and follow the long hill down.  (Buses on the hour back up the hill – mine host Richard has the time-table).  Full of characters, historic and a firm favourite not to be missed.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Places To Go</h3>
			<p>You are fortunately situated in one of the loveliest counties in Britain and there are numerous places to visit within walking or driving distance.  Just a brief selection is:</p>
			<p>Lower Town.  (See ‘Ship Inn’ overleaf.) If you are feeling energetic this is a lovely short walk with pretty views.   Turn right out of Ty Gwyn, first right and right again at the end.   Go down the steep hill to the harbour at Lower Town.  Stop at the historic Ship Inn for a drink with mine hosts Richard and Jan.   It’s like a cosy front room.  See photos on the wall of Gregory Peck when Moby Dick was filmed there and also Richard Burton whilst filming Under Milkwood.  If you come back the same way it’s a real killer, so I suggest following the water all the way around until you see a Tarmac slope on the left – you can’t miss it as you can’t walk any further.  You then come up the Slade which brings you back to the centre of Fishguard.  It’s still steep but a bit more stretched out and not nearly as bad as the main road.</p>
			<p>Pwllgwaelodd – This is the nearest beach to the cottage.    Turn right at the end of the road and right again through Lower Town towards Cardigan.  You will see a sign for Pwllgwaelod after about five minutes.</p>
			<p>Bluestone – If the weather is wet and you are looking for somewhere to take the kids you can’t go far wrong with a day in the pool at Bluestone.  It’s situated just outside Narberth and well sign-posted.  The indoor lagoon is great fun with water sides, lazy river etc.</p>
			<p>Pembrokeshire Coastal Path – Maintained by the National Trust and wonderful views and fresh air.   The Puffin Shuttle and Poppit Rocket bus services run from Market Sq and will drop you off at various points so that you can walk back.</p>
			<p>St David’s – No visit would be complete without a visit to this fabulous tiny city, the smallest in the UK.  The cathedral there is simply breathtaking and dates back to the 11th Century.</p>
			<p>Solva – Keep going on the same road after passing through St David’s for a further few miles until you come to the picturesque little town of Solva with its beautiful harbour and interesting shops and pubs.  Slow down on the steep hill and turn into the car park before stopping for a snack in The Harbour pub overlooking the bay.</p>
			<p>Newgale  -  Again proceed in the same direction after leaving Solva and after ten minutes or so you will come to Newgale, a huge, windswept beach, of mainly pebbles.   Very popular with serious windsurfers and well worth a brief visit and a cuppa in the beach café.</p>
			<p>Haverfordwest. An interesting little town and the nearest place for good shopping (called ‘Harford’ locally).  About 9 miles from Fishguard.</p>
			<p>Miranda’s Preserves.   Take the road out of Fishguard and along the Parrog towards the ferry terminal.   Go straight over to Goodwick and up the steep hill.  Keep going right through Goodwick on the same road as if you were going towards Strumble Head.   About half a mile after Goodwick you will see a large white house on the left with a table full of fare and a trust box outside.  Lovely pickles and especially nice lemon curd.  She has won many Taste of Wales awards for her fabulous, natural produce.  Great views of the harbour on the way back.</p>
			<p>Porthgain – Well worth a visit just for a look even if you are not eating at The Sloop.  Watch the kids by the edge as it’s a steep fall into the harbour and no railings!</p>
			<p>Whitesands Beach.  A bit further on the same road and about two miles before St David’s.  If you haven’t been there it’s worth a visit, especially in summer.  Voted the best beach in Britain several times.  Car park fee about £3 per day.  Beach café.</p>
			<p>Cwm Yr Eglwys.  A personal favourite if you want an old fashioned day on the beach with the kids.  No shops or amusements – just a small, sheltered beach (where you can keep an eye on the little ones), rock pools (for crabbing) and a boats slipway.  Limited parking so get there early if the sun is out.  Leave the cottage and head right and right again towards Cardigan.   After a few miles keep an eye out for a left hand turn sign-posted ‘Cwm Yr Elgwys’.  Turn left and follow the country road for about a mile – actually the end of the road is a dead end into the car park.  Parking about £2.00 all day.  Take sandwiches and drinks with you if you are going for the day.  [Incidentally one other point of interest are the remains of St Brynach’s Church situated just before the beach – it was destroyed in a great storm in the 16th century].</p>
			<p>Llys y Fran Country Park.   Lovely park with free entry.  Great if you want to take a picnic or kick a ball about with the kids.  Loads of woodland paths and you can hire bicycles there for a small fee and cycle all the way around – about 7 miles.  However having done this recently wouldn’t recommend it unless you are fit – it’s sweetly described as ‘challenging’!   Drive left from the cottage towards Maenclochog. This road takes you through the Gwaun Valley. Just keep going on the same road following signs for Narbeth – lovely views – until you eventually come to a T junction with Llys Y Fran s/p on the left.</p>
			<p>Th Dyffrun Arms – Known to all and sundry as ‘Bessie’s’.  This is a pub situated in the heart of the Gwaun Valley (‘Cwm Gwaun’) about two miles from the cottage and is famous for the (very) old Welsh speaking lady who serves beer in jugs in what passes for her living room.  Apparently Bessie’s is rated above St David’s Cathedral for ‘Things not to Miss’ in Pembrokeshire!!  Living history!</p>
